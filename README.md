`twf` is a Perl script that can turn a family tree (documented using what I'll
call a _tree walk format_ flat file) into a `groff/dot` diagram. The groff/dot
output generated by `twf` can then be post processed (using `dot` or any of the
other tools in the `groff` tool set) to generate output in other/more human
readable formats, say, for example, pdf, which can show the relationships within
a family tree in a more diagrammatic/pictorial form.

An example file (`abe.twf`) shows the input format used by the `twf` script and
it depicts the relationships documented in the Book of Genesis in the Bible
starting from Abraham.

Running `make` in this directory will generate a pdf file which uses `abe.twf`
as the input file and documents a minimal subset of Abraham's family tree.

An informal grammar that describes the _tree walk format_ using something that
resembles YACC/Bison (while borrowing some additional functionality such as the
'%%' delimiter and "rule" notation from Perl6/Raku) is shown below:

```
// a "tree walk format"/twf input file consists of ...
twf	: ( family '\n' )+	// ... one or more families, listed one per line
family	: ( person %% '|')+	// a family consists of persons delimited by '|'
person	: name ( ',' age )? op	// a person has a name and an optional age
person	: '?'			// a person's name may be unknown
age	: '?' | number '?'?	// the age of the person may be unknown ...
		// ... which is denoted by a '?' or it could be a known number
		// which may be suffixed with a '?' to denote if it is doubtful
number	: [0-9]+		// age (at time of death) is just a whole number
name	: realname ( \s '(' nickname ')' )?	// a person may have a different
				// optional earlier name and/or a nickname
realname: [^\,\(\#\|]+		// names can have anything including spaces ...
nickname: [^\,\(\#\|\)]+	// .. except some special characters
op	: [\.]?			// the '.' operator denotes no descendants
```

Note that while doing genealogy research, the age of the deceased may be
unknown (and sometimes disputed/unbelievable, such as the ones listed for
Abraham and his family) and these can be denoted using '?'.

Turning the `twf` format into the more well known `GEDCOM` format is left as
an exercise for the reader. The primary (only?) advantage of `twf` over `GEDCOM`
is that it is meant to be hand editable using any text editor of your choice.
